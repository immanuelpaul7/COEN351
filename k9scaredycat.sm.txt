They'll Rust, but They'll Never Run Away!

 **Made in USA**

Recycled materials are used in hand-crafting each one of these wonderful little curiosities, made from scrap and rejected garden tools, farm machinery, bicycle and auto parts, and more. Buying one of these unique junkyard creations not only livens up your home or garden but also reduces solid waste otherwise destined for landfills. If everyone bought two or three, we could just about save the entire earth. Seriously though, we estimate over two million pounds of scrap has already been used to make these Recycled Junkyard Cats!

Each Recycled Junkyard Cat has its own distinctive personality. While there are certain regular designs serving as templates, no two animals are exactly alike. Whether it's the turn of the head, the placement of the eyes, or some other slight variation, each Recycled Junkyard Cat has a delightful disposition all its own.
